Names were changed by using make.names() - it creates safe and unique names. Such names cannot affect functions or any other R operations. For the purpose of this project, there is no need to manually adjust them any further manually.


"Subject" - 30 people partiticipating in data collection. Each person has number assigned (1-30)
"Activity" - 6 different activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING.
